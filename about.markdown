# Hi, my name is Amara.

I am a full-time data analyst based in Raleigh, NC. I graduated with honors from NC State University where 
I studied Statistics and ran Women's Track & Field. Upon graduating I accepted a position at MetLife's Global 
Technology Hub writing functional requirements for software developers. I now work on MetLife's US Marketing 
Analytics team where I measure and optimize and marketing campaigns across multiple channels.

In my free time I enjoy photography, SUP paddle boarding, and anything that involves exercise!
